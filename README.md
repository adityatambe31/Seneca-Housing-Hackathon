# 🏡 Student Housing - Data for Density and Commute

Welcome to the Student Housing project! This initiative aims to tackle the challenges faced by students in finding affordable housing and convenient commute options, particularly for those attending Seneca College.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Students often struggle to find suitable housing that is both affordable and close to their campus. To address these issues, our team, **Team Muchachos**, has developed a comprehensive solution focusing on two primary objectives:
1. **Optimizing Housing Density:** Identify neighborhoods with the highest availability of rental rooms.
2. **Enhancing Commute Options:** Implement a dedicated shuttle bus service from key neighborhoods to Newnham Campus.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Neighborhood Analysis:** 
  - Evaluated 8 neighborhoods: North York, Markham, Vaughan, Hamilton, Brampton, Etobicoke, Mississauga, and Scarborough.
  - Identified 147 available rooms for rent, ensuring at least 20 rooms per neighborhood.
  
- **Commute Optimization:**
  - Designed shuttle bus routes for Vaughan and Mississauga.
  - Analyzed different travel routes considering distance, speed, and travel time.
  
- **Student & Seneca Benefits:**
  - **Students:** Cost-effective travel, more housing options, and safer commutes.
  - **Seneca:** Increased student enrollment from targeted neighborhoods, competitive edge, and job creation.
  
- **Resource Requirements:**
  - Budget for shuttle buses ranges from $6,700 to $13,500 CAD depending on the neighborhood coverage.
  - Suggested shuttle schedule includes morning, noon, afternoon, and evening services.

## 📈 Data Insights
